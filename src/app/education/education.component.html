        In secondary school, we played a lot of <a class="hvr-pulse" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoons">spoons</a> at lunchtime in our canteen. I also happened to take a number of GCSEs and achieved 7 A grades, 2 A* grades and a Distinction in ICT: Digital Applications. But yeah, you should play spoons if you haven't before...

        Here, I discovered the immense joy and satisfaction of programming through A-Level Computing. As A2 coursework, I created a Tuition Management System using VB.NET. I also took Mathematics and History.

        With exposure to the wide range of fields in computing, it soon became very clear that software development was where my interest laid. During this time, a number of team and individual projects were conducted particularly to do with web applications using Ruby on Rails. E.g. a student registration and staff monitoring system and a gamification system for unit testing for my dissertation project.

  <h2 class="hvr-wobble-vertical"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> A bit about me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a <mark>software developer</mark> and recently graduated from the University of Sheffield with a degree in Computer Science. From my time at university, I acquired a particular interest in web applications due to their versatile nature, especially with the growth of Progressive Web Apps (PWA). I primarily have experience using Ruby on Rails however, I have begun an exploration into other web application platforms with the use of Angular to create this PWA.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve always been drawn to and fascinated by <mark>technology</mark> since I was young. I think I was born at the perfect time to see its progression, whether that be the evolution of the internet, mobile phones or gaming. My aspiration to become a software engineer was progressive but I knew I was always going to gear my education to a career in technology. It started from my silly phone and gaming interest to choosing ICT in GCSEs, to choosing A-Level Computing and Mathematics and then completing a Computer Science degree. After automating Feastly Ltd’s client lunch menus process, I find myself craving to develop something for people again. It's <mark>incredibly rewarding</mark> to know that you’ve made <mark>someone’s life a bit easier</mark>. Also, programming is just <mark>fun</mark>! It’s challenging and therefore really satisfying when you solve problems and see something develop that you've built from the ground up.
  </p>
  <p>
    <mark>Now as a graduate, I look forward to utilising, improving and adding to my current skill set in a fun, collaborative and challenging environment under the mentorship of more experienced teammates.</mark>

            <p>In the office catering company, I collaborated with the director in the first few stages of software development by designing a web application that catered specifically for the companyâ€™s needs in managing and improving their core menu and recipe building process. I also created client lunch menu pages for their WordPress website. The lunch menus were located in a Google Sheets document, read in JSON format and outputted using PHP and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>As an intern, I shadowed an IT Support Engineer and learnt to prepare and resolve client enquiries. I also assisted with the company's migration to a new system, handled client queries over the phone and carried out hands-on tasks such as preparing a new laptop for a client following their standard procedure.</p>

        Ah, my first proper job. I mainly operated the tills but sometimes I'd make sure customers had food to buy by stocking shelves. I also aided customers when on the shop floor.

        As an intern I was mainly assigned administrative tasks. I did get to shadow an IT Support Engineer and occasionally carried out some small hand-on tasks such as preparing a new laptop for a client following their standard procedure.

      <p>
        In the office catering company, I collaborated with the director in the first few stages of software development by designing a web application to manage and improve their core menu and recipe building process. I also created client lunch menu pages for their WordPress website. The lunch menus were located in a Google Sheets document, read in JSON format and outputted using PHP and JavaScript.
